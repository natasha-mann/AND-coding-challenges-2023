# üèÜ Challenge 1 - "Control C, Control V" üìã

Welcome back! Here's a fun little string manipulation challenge to kick things off. The challenge is to analyse these strings for any instances of `[CTRL+C]` and `[CTRL+V]`. When `[CTRL+C]` is encountered, the contents of the string before it should be 'copied' to a clipboard. Upon any instance of `[CTRL+V]` in the string, this clipboard should be pasted in its place. If `[CTRL+V]` is encountered before any corresponding `[CTRL+C]` then it should simply paste nothing.

## Getting Started

To run the algorithm, edit the string passed to the `formatString` function in the `index.ts` file and run `npm run start`

## Tests

```
npm run test
```

## Rewards:

5Ô∏è‚É£ Points are awarded for a working algorithm as described above

3Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for supporting [CTRL+X], which should remove the preceding text before copying it to the clipboard

2Ô∏è‚É£ Further points are awarded for validating your solution with a collection of unit tests

### Example:

For this example input:

```
challenge("the first [CTRL+C] Coding Challenge was [CTRL+V] string manipulation task")
```

Your solution might output:

```
"the first Coding Challenge was the first string manipulation task"
```
